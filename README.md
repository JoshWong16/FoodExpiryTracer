# FoodExpiryTracer

Food waste is a major issue in the modern world. Our aim is to reduce food waste through raising user awarness of the food they already have. This app holds an inventory of grocery items along with their expiry date.

Items can easily be added to the list by taking a picture of it. It is achieved by our optimized machine learning model we developed using TensorFlow in Python. The model has been trained using 25 diffirent grocery items.

Once added, the data is then stored in Google Cloud's Firestore Database. With the apps real time listener to the clound database, the user can view and interact with their inventory without much delay.
